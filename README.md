## About Me

I am a **Manual Tester transitioning into Test Automation**, with hands-on experience in testing web and desktop applications.

I work with:
- exploratory, regression and integration testing  
- API testing (Postman, DevTools)  
- test analysis, defect reporting and collaboration with developers  

I am currently developing my **automation skills in Java** as part of the EPAM specialization program, combining manual testing experience with automated testing practices.

This GitHub profile serves as a **practical portfolio** of my learning path and testing work.

## What You Will Find Here

This profile contains repositories that demonstrate:

- Java-based automated tests (JUnit 5, Maven)
- unit and API testing projects
- test design and data-driven testing
- structured test approaches and clean test architecture
- gradual transition from manual to automated testing

Repositories are updated continuously as part of learning and real project work.

## Current Focus

- strengthening automation foundations in Java  
- writing readable, maintainable test code  
- improving test structure and reusability  
- extending automation with:
  - Selenium / Selenide UI tests
  - test reports
  - CI integration (Jenkins)

## Open to Collaboration

I am open to opportunities where I can grow as a **QA / Automation Tester**, learn from real projects and contribute to testing quality.
